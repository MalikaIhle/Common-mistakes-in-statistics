Wolfgang: once you have a local copy of this repository on your machine:
0. Open the reprosiotry by double clicking on the .Rproj file
1. Pull (blue arrow pointing down) - in case I have made changes
2. make edits and save files
3. tick boxes near files you want to share/publish updates
4. click commit and write a commit text describing your edits
5. click push (green arrow up)
6. go to the github repo to see if changes were indeed pushed online.
